  abstract = {Recently there has been a flurry of research on the use of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) in wireless networks to create smart radio environments. In a smart radio environment, surfaces are capable of manipulating the propagation of incident electromagnetic waves in a programmable manner to actively alter the channel realization, which turns the wireless channel into a controllable system block that can be optimized to improve overall system performance. In this article, we provide a tutorial overview of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) for wireless communications. We describe the working principles of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) and elaborate on different candidate implementations using metasurfaces and reflectarrays. We discuss the channel models suitable for both implementations and examine the feasibility of obtaining accurate channel estimates. Furthermore, we discuss the aspects that differentiate RIS optimization from precoding for traditional MIMO arrays highlighting both the arising challenges and the potential opportunities associated with this emerging technology. Finally, we present numerical results to illustrate the power of an RIS in shaping the key properties of a MIMO channel.},

  abstract = {The future of mobile communications looks exciting with the potential new use cases and challenging requirements of future 6th generation (6G) and beyond wireless networks. Since the beginning of the modern era of wireless communications, the propagation medium has been perceived as a randomly behaving entity between the transmitter and the receiver, which degrades the quality of the received signal due to the uncontrollable interactions of the transmitted radio waves with the surrounding objects. The recent advent of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces in wireless communications enables, on the other hand, network operators to control the scattering, reflection, and refraction characteristics of the radio waves, by overcoming the negative effects of natural wireless propagation. Recent results have revealed that reconfigurable intelligent surfaces can effectively control the wavefront, e.g., the phase, amplitude, frequency, and even polarization, of the impinging signals without the need of complex decoding, encoding, and radio frequency processing operations. Motivated by the potential of this emerging technology, the present article is aimed to provide the readers with a detailed overview and historical perspective on state-of-the-art solutions, and to elaborate on the fundamental differences with other technologies, the most important open research issues to tackle, and the reasons why the use of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces necessitates to rethink the communication-theoretic models currently employed in wireless networks. This article also explores theoretical performance limits of reconfigurable intelligent surface-assisted communication systems using mathematical techniques and elaborates on the potential use cases of intelligent surfaces in 6G and beyond wireless networks.},

  abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have promising coverage and data-rate gains for wireless communication systems in 5G and beyond. Prior work has mainly focused on analyzing the performance of these surfaces using simulations or lab-level prototypes. To draw accurate insights about the actual performance of these systems, this paper develops an RIS proof-of-concept prototype and extensively evaluates its potential gains in the field under realistic wireless communication settings. In particular, a 160-element RIS, operating at a 5.8 GHz band, is designed, fabricated, and accurately measured in the anechoic chamber. This surface is then integrated into a wireless communication system and the beamforming gains, pathloss, and coverage improvements are evaluated in realistic outdoor communication scenarios. When both the transmitter and receiver employ directional antennas, the developed RIS achieves 15–20 dB gain in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in a range of ±60° beamforming angles. In terms of coverage, and considering a far-field experiment with a blockage between a basestation and a grid of mobile users and with an average signal path of 35 m, the RIS provides an average SNR improvement of 6 dB (max 8 dB) within an area > 75 m2. Thanks to the scalable RIS design, these SNR gains can be directly increased with larger RIS areas. For example, a single 1,600-element RIS with the same design is expected to provide 26 dB SNR gain for a similar deployment (theoretical estimation). These results draw useful insights into the design and performance of RIS systems and provide an important proof for their potential gains in real-world far-field wireless communication environments.},

  abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are considered a promising technology for boosting the coverage and for enhancing the spectral efficiency of wireless systems, as well as for taming the wireless environment. The potential benefits of RISs are currently being analyzed and various approaches are being proposed to address the challenges for their integration in wireless networks. Currently available studies to quantify the potential gains of deploying RISs in wireless networks are limited to simple network topologies, while no system-level assessments have been reported to date. Network-level, for example, on the scale of hundreds of square meters, simulations are, however, the first step to quantify the actual value of emerging technologies and the steppingstone before considering large scale system-level experimental evaluations and network deployments. Toward this direction, this article reports the first system-level simulation results and analysis of an RIS deployment in a typical urban city that is served by a fifth-generation cellular network. The obtained system-level simulation results unveil that the benefits of RISs vary depending on the operating frequency and the size of the surfaces. Specifically, we investigate the performance improvement that RISs can provide, in terms of outdoor and indoor coverage and per resource block rate, when deployed in mid (C-band) and high (millimeter-wave) frequency bands. For example, the obtained results unveil that the deployment of RISs enhances the coverage probability from 77 percent to 95 percent in the C-band and from 46 percent to 95 percent (92 percent in the presence of network interference) in the millimeter-wave band.},

Jamming and eavesdropping are two primary attacks at the physical layer of a wireless network. This article offers a tutorial on several prevalent methods to enhance security at the physical layer in wireless networks. We classify these methods based on their characteristic features into five categories, each of which is discussed in terms of two metrics. First, we compare their secret channel capacities, and then we show their computational complexities in exhaustive key search.

In this article, I briefly review several different flavors of physical layer security (at least for wireless systems), and then identify aspects (a.k.a. weaknesses) where the foundation for physical layer security needs to be strengthened. I then highlight that the opportunities for applying physical layer security to real systems will be quite rich if the community can overcome these challenges.

  abstract = {This paper provides a comprehensive review of the domain of physical layer security in multiuser wireless networks. The essential premise of physical layer security is to enable the exchange of confidential messages over a wireless medium in the presence of unauthorized eavesdroppers, without relying on higher-layer encryption. This can be achieved primarily in two ways: without the need for a secret key by intelligently designing transmit coding strategies, or by exploiting the wireless communication medium to develop secret keys over public channels. The survey begins with an overview of the foundations dating back to the pioneering work of Shannon and Wyner on information-theoretic security. We then describe the evolution of secure transmission strategies from point-to-point channels to multiple-antenna systems, followed by generalizations to multiuser broadcast, multiple-access, interference, and relay networks. Secret-key generation and establishment protocols based on physical layer mechanisms are subsequently covered. Approaches for secrecy based on channel coding design are then examined, along with a description of inter-disciplinary approaches based on game theory and stochastic geometry. The associated problem of physical layer message authentication is also briefly introduced. The survey concludes with observations on potential research directions in this area.},

  abstract = {The potential of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) for energy-efficient and performance-boosted wireless communications is recently gaining remarkable research attention, motivating their consideration for various 5-th Generation (5G) Advanced and beyond applications. In this paper, we consider a Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) Physical Layer Security (PLS) system with multiple data streams including one legitimate passive RIS and one malicious passive RIS, with the former being transparent to the multi-antenna eavesdropper and the latter’s presence being unknown at the legitimate multi-antenna transceivers. We first present a novel threat model for the RIS-boosted eavesdropping system and design a joint optimization framework for the eavesdropper’s receive combining matrix and the reflection coefficients of the malicious RIS. Focusing next on the secrecy rate maximization problem, we present an RIS-empowered PLS scheme that jointly designs the legitimate precoding matrix and number of data streams, the Artificial Noise (AN) covariance matrix, the receive combining matrix, and the reflection coefficients of the legitimate RIS. The proposed optimization algorithms, whose convergence to at least local optimum points is proved, are based on alternating maximization, minorization-maximization, and manifold optimization, including semi-closed form expressions for the optimization variables. Our extensive simulation results for two representative system setups reveal that, in the absence of a legitimate RIS, transceiver spatial filtering and AN are incapable of offering non-zero secrecy rates, even for malicious RISs with small numbers of elements. However, when an  $L$ -element legitimate RIS is deployed, confidential communication can be safeguarded against eavesdropping systems possessing even more than a  $5L$ -element malicious RIS.},

  abstract = {The reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is envisioned to create ultra-secure wireless networks. Previous works on the RIS-assisted security provisioning techniques assumed wiretap channel information at the transmitter, which is practically unavailable in a passive eavesdropping scenario. In this article, we consider a point-to-point anti-eavesdropping system in which a RIS is used to enable the secure transmission from a multi-antenna transmitter to a multi-antenna legitimate receiver. A passive eavesdropper, whose channel state information is completely unknown, attempts to decode the secret messages. We propose a security approach by using the reflection at the RIS as multiplicative randomness against the wiretapper. Specifically, the reflection coefficients in terms of amplitude and phase are updated in each transmission and kept private at the RIS. Through the reflection designs, the effective channel matrix is diagonalized at the legitimate receiver. In contrast, the eavesdropper receives coupled signals with the weights of the randomness at RIS. The main contributions of this article are three reflection designs and correspondingly three secure transmission schemes, which fulfills diverse requirements of the balance amongst performance metrics including the degrees of randomness, spectral efficiency, and reliability. The main benefits of the proposed secure transmission schemes are four-fold. First, the transmitter does not need to know the eavesdropper's channel states. Second, closed-form solutions for the reflection coefficients are provided. Third, the legitimate receiver has a linear decoding complexity. Fourth, the unauthorized wiretapper is unable to cancel out the multiplicative randomness and thus cannot extract much useful information. Numerical results show that exploiting the RIS as a source of multiplicative randomness provides a new perspective to improve the security of the wireless networks.},

RIS technologies are emerging as an important paradigm for the realisation of smart radio environments, where large numbers of small, low-cost and passive elements, reflect the incident signal with an adjustable phase shift without requiring a dedicated energy source. Inspired by the promising potential of RIS-based transmission, we investigate two vehicular network system models: One with vehicle-to-vehicle communication with the source employing a RIS-based access point, and the other model in the form of a vehicular adhoc network (VANET), with a RIS-based relay deployed on a building. Both models assume the presence of an eavesdropper to investigate the average secrecy capacity of the considered systems. Monte-Carlo simulations are provided throughout to validate the results. The results show that performance of the system in terms of the secrecy capacity is affected by the location of the RIS-relay and the number of RIS cells. The effect of other system parameters such as source power and eavesdropper distances are also studied.},

The transmitter ensures secrecy of communication by utilizing some of the available power to produce 'artificial noise', such that only the eavesdropper's channel is degraded. Two scenarios are considered, one where the transmitter has multiple transmit antennas, and the other where amplifying relays simulate the effect of multiple antennas.

Both the transmitter and the receiver are assumed to have multiple antennas and the multiple colluding eavesdroppers are modeled by an eavesdropper with multiple antennas. Communication is secret if the eavesdropper is unable to decode the message whereas the receiver can decode the message without making any errors. Thus, we deal with the problem of secrecy in a MIMO scenario. It is shown how the transmitter can use the multiple antennas to add artificially generated noise to the information signal such that the artificial noise only degrades the eavesdropper's channel. Thus, even if the eavesdropper has a 'better' channel than the receiver, secret communication is made possible by selectively degrading the eavesdropper's channel. The secrecy of communication is achieved by exploiting the physical characteristics of the wireless medium and it is independent of the secrecy of channel state information (CSI)},

By adjusting the reflecting coefficients, the IRS can change the attenuation and scattering of the incident electromagnetic wave so that it can propagate in the desired way toward the intended receiver. Specifically, we consider a downlink multiple-input single-output (MISO) broadcast system, where the base station (BS) transmits independent data streams to multiple legitimate receivers and keeps them secret from multiple eavesdroppers. By jointly optimizing the beamformers at the BS and reflecting coefficients at the IRS, we formulate a minimum-secrecy-rate maximization problem under various practical constraints on the reflecting coefficients. The constraints capture the scenarios of both continuous and discrete reflecting coefficients of the reflecting elements. Due to the non-convexity of the formulated problem, we propose an efficient algorithm based on the alternating optimization and the path-following algorithm to solve it in an iterative manner. Besides, we show that the proposed algorithm can converge to a local (global) optimum. Furthermore, we develop two suboptimal algorithms with some forms of closed-form solutions to reduce computational complexity. Finally, the simulation results validate the advantages of the introduced IRS and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract = {Unprecedented growth in wireless data traffic, and ever-increasing demand for highly secured, and low-latency wireless communication has motivated the research community to move towards sixth-generation (6G) technology, where networks can cater to the rising need for ubiquitous secure wireless connectivity. One of the promising technologies for 6G wireless communication is the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) concept that is proposed to successfully deal with increasing security threats by smartly controlling the wireless channel conditions. This survey paper presents a detailed literature review on RIS-assisted physical layer security (PLS) for next-generation wireless communications. Firstly, we briefly discuss the PLS concept, its importance, the PLS performance metrics, and its applicability in different wireless networks. Next, we discuss the applications of RIS in the 6G scenario. Then, a detailed and systematic classification of the various RIS-assisted wireless system topologies exhibiting multiple scenarios, system models, channel fading models, performance metrics and objectives is done. The existing state-of-art approaches for PLS such as secret key generation (SKG), optimization algorithms, namely semidefinite relaxation-successive convex approximation (SDR-SCA) to optimize RIS coefficients, and optimal placement of RIS units are discussed for single-input single-output (SISO) case. For multiple-input single-output (MISO) case, PLS strategies such as inducing artificial noise (AN), optimization algorithms, alternating optimization (AO), machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), and reflect matrices are discussed. Similarly, for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) setup, block coordinate descent (BCD) and AN induction are some of the PLS methods used to analyze the secrecy. Lastly, we present some of the technical challenges and future directions based on the survey.},

It begins by introducing key RIS concepts and classifying them into passive, active, and hybrid types, with particular focus on beyond diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) and its various architectural designs. The study then delves into the evolution of vehicular communication technologies, followed by channel modeling and strategies to ensure long-term system adaptability.

  abstract       = {Recently, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have received much interest from both academia and industry due to their flexibility and cost-effectiveness in adjusting the phase and amplitude of wireless signals with low-cost passive reflecting elements. In particular, many RIS-aided techniques have been proposed to improve both data rate and energy efficiency for 6G wireless communication systems. In this paper, we propose a novel RIS-based channel randomization (RCR) technique for improving physical-layer security (PLS) for a time-division duplex (TDD) downlink cellular wire-tap network which consists of a single base station (BS) with multiple antennas, multiple legitimate pieces of user equipment (UE), multiple eavesdroppers (EVEs), and multiple RISs. We assume that only a line-of-sight (LOS) channel exists among the BS, the RISs, and the UE due to propagation characteristics of tera-hertz (THz) spectrum bands that may be used in 6G wireless communication systems. In the proposed technique, each RIS first pseudo-randomly generates multiple reflection matrices and utilizes them for both pilot signal duration (PSD) in uplink and data transmission duration (DTD) in downlink. Then, the BS estimates wireless channels of UE with reflection matrices of all RISs and selects the UE that has the best secrecy rate for each reflection matrix generated. It is shown herein that the proposed technique outperforms the conventional techniques in terms of achievable secrecy rates.},

This paper gives Las Vegas algorithms for finding discrete logarithms and factoring integers on a quantum computer that take a number of steps which is polynomial in the input size, e.g., the number of digits of the integer to be factored. These two problems are generally considered hard on a classical computer and have been used as the basis of several proposed cryptosystems.

  abstract = {Future connected vehicles will require high-performance communication technologies for advanced cooperative driving applications such as maneuvering and cooperative perception. mmWave communications can meet the bandwidth requirements of such applications, but the typically harsh propagation conditions of vehicular environments hinder the broad adoption of mmWave devices on cars. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can help mitigate this problem by enabling the reflection of signals in a configurable direction. In turn, this can result in more stable non-line of sight (NLoS) links whenever a LoS path is not available. RISs have recently gained attention in the vehicular domain but, while providing benefits, they also introduce a lot of research challenges. To measure their effectiveness at scale, it is necessary to develop simulation tools that can reproduce their characteristics with high fidelity and federate them with existing cooperative driving simulation frameworks. In this work we present CoopeRIS, an open-source simulation framework federated within the Plexe/Veins/SUMO ecosystem, capable of modeling and simulating RIS-based mmWave communications in a vehicular environment. We exploit CoopeRIS to perform an initial feasibility study, highlighting the challenges ahead and the performance RISs need to deliver in order to enable this type of communication. In addition we propose a method to combine multiple RIS configurations into a single one to enable multi-user service delivery, showing its performance via CoopeRIS. The insights we presents within this work show the potential of such simulation framework and thus how the community can build further research work on top if it.}

Balancing these concerns, we decompose the SpGEMM operation into three highly parallel phases: expansion, sorting, and contraction, and introduce a set of complementary bandwidth-saving performance optimizations. Our implementation is fully general and our optimization strategy adaptively processes the SpGEMM workload row-wise to substantially improve performance by decreasing the work complexity and utilizing the memory hierarchy more effectively.},

Fading is exploited for multiple-input multiple-output(MIMO) channels to provide better performance over conventional amplitude/phase modulation (APM) techniques. In SSK, it is the antenna index used during transmission that relays information, rather than the transmitted symbols themselves. This absence of symbol information eliminates the transceiver elements necessary for APM transmission and detection (such as coherent detectors). As well, the simplicity involved in modulation reduces the detection complexity compared to that of SM, while achieving almost identical performance gains. Throughout the paper, we illustrate SSK's strength by studying its interaction with the fading channel. We obtain tight upper bounds on bit error probability, and discuss SSK's performance under some non-ideal channel conditions (estimation error and spatial correlation). Analytical and simulation results show performance gains over APM systems (3 dB at a bit error rate of 10-5), making SSK an interesting candidate for future wireless applications. We then extend SSK concepts to incorporate channel coding, where in particular, we consider a bit interleaved coded modulation (BICM) system using iterative decoding for both convolutional and turbo codes. Capacity results are derived, and improvements over APM are illustrated (up to 1 bits/s/Hz), with performance gains of up to 5 dB.},

  abstract = {Multi-layer security and information assurance frameworks will become essential as potential attackers' resources continue to grow. Due to its growing use and obvious vulnerability, wireless communication is in particular need of protection. As available computational power increases, transmitters will be able to implement sophisticated preceding to increase transmission security. In this paper, we consider the security-enhancing capability of algebraic channel decomposition multiplexing (ACDM), a form of multipulse spread-spectrum preceding for dispersive wireless channels that results in in orthogonal signaling at the receiver. In ACDM, the transmit code vectors are determined from the SVD of the convolution matrix describing the channel between the transmitter and desired receiver. Since any potential transmitter-eavesdropper channel will have a different multipath structure, eavesdroppers' ability to detect and decode the transmissions can be severely reduced. We develop semi-analytical formulae for the performance penalty experienced by an eaves-dropper employing the optimum linear MMSE receiver under the worst-case assumptions that it has perfect knowledge of the transmit code set and its own channel response. Using realistic channel models we demonstrate that such an eavesdropper experiences a significant performance degradation, and show that this degradation is due to a combination of diversity loss and inter-code interference.},

URLLC enables various mission-critical applications by facilitating reliable and low-latency signal transmission. Apart from reliability and latency, ensuring the security of URLLC data transmission has been a prominent issue in recent years. URLLC uses finite blocklength signals to achieve the stringent reliability and latency requirement which eliminates the possibility of using conventional complex secret key-based cryptographic techniques. In this regard, lightweight security mechanisms like physical layer Security (PLS) have emerged as a powerful alternative to the complex cryptographic security techniques for URLLC by exploiting the randomness of the wireless channel. Therefore, this survey presents a comprehensive and in-depth review of the state-of-the-art PLS enhancements utilized to unleash secure URLLC in 5G and upcoming sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. Moreover, the survey discusses the impact of system design parameters on the PLS of URLLC. It also incorporates a detailed overview of the recent advancements in ensuring PLS for mission-critical applications, URLLC enabling technologies, and Machine Learning (ML) based intelligent PLS schemes for URLLC. Then, for the first time, the survey introduces the extended service class of URLLC in 6G, i.e., Hyper Reliable Low Latency Communication (HRLLC), and provides an outlook on the future security aspects while identifying various promising new technologies that can provide secure HRLLC in 6G. Finally, the survey discusses several key challenges and identifies interesting future research directions for developing efficient PLS schemes for 5G URLLC and HRLLC service in 6G wireless networks.},

This paper presents an improved path-loss model suitable for RIS-aided wireless communications. Unlike previously reported RIS path-loss models, the proposed model considers more practical electromagnetic phenomena (e.g., the incident and reflected gain patterns of the RIS unit cell, the effective received power at the RIS, the reflection phase error of each unit cell, and the specular reflection loss), by applying rigorous analysis. Furthermore, the accuracy of the proposed path-loss model is validated by extensive experimental measurements using our developed RIS prototype. The prototype consists of 576 phase-reconfigurable unit cells operating at 29 GHz, each of which features two PIN diodes. Each PIN diode is independently controlled to produce the desired phase distributions on the RIS. It is shown that the calculated received power in the proposed path-loss model matches the measurement results within a 1 dB margin across various practical test environments.},

  abstract = {The concept of Smart Cities has been introduced as a way to benefit from the digitization of various ecosystems at a city level. To support this concept, future communication networks need to be carefully designed with respect to the city infrastructure and utilization of resources. Recently, the idea of ‘smart’ environment, which takes advantage of the infrastructure in order to enable better performance of wireless networks, has been proposed. This idea is aligned with the recent advances in design of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), which are planar structures with the capability to reflect impinging electromagnetic waves toward preferred directions. Thus, RISs are expected to provide the necessary flexibility for the design of the ‘smart’ communication environment, which can be optimally shaped to enable cost- and energy-efficient signal transmissions where needed. Upon deployment of RISs, the ecosystem of the Smart Cities would become even more controllable and adaptable, which would subsequently ease the implementation of future communication networks in urban areas and boost the interconnection among private households and public services. In this article, we provide our vision on RIS integration into future Smart Cities by pointing out some forward-looking new application scenarios and use cases and by highlighting the potential advantages of RIS deployment. To this end, we identify the most promising research directions and opportunities. The respective design problems are formulated mathematically. Moreover, we focus the discussion on the key enabling aspects for RIS-assisted Smart Cities, which require substantial research efforts such as pilot decontamination, precoding for large multiuser networks, distributed operation and control of RISs. These contributions pave the road to a systematic design of RIS-assisted communication networks for Smart Cities in the years to come.},

  abstract = {Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) is a promising solution to reconfigure the wireless environment in a controllable way. To compensate for the double-fading attenuation in the RIS-aided link, a large number of passive reflecting elements (REs) are conventionally deployed at the RIS, resulting in large surface size and considerable circuit power consumption. In this paper, we propose a new type of RIS, called active RIS, where each RE is assisted by active loads (negative resistance), that reflect and amplify the incident signal instead of only reflecting it with the adjustable phase shift as in the case of a passive RIS. Therefore, for a given power budget at the RIS, a strengthened RIS-aided link can be achieved by increasing the number of active REs as well as amplifying the incident signal. We consider the use of an active RIS to a single input multiple output (SIMO) system. However, it would unintentionally amplify the RIS-correlated noise, and thus the proposed system has to balance the conflict between the received signal power maximization and the RIS-correlated noise minimization at the receiver. To achieve this goal, it has to optimize the reflecting coefficient matrix at the RIS and the receive beamforming at the receiver. An alternating optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. Specifically, the receive beamforming is obtained with a closed-form solution based on linear minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) criterion, while the reflecting coefficient matrix is obtained by solving a series of sequential convex approximation (SCA) problems. Simulation results show that the proposed active RIS-aided system could achieve better performance over the conventional passive RIS-aided system with the same power budget.},

The main observation is that very high rates and/or large metasurfaces are needed to outperform DF relaying, both in terms of minimizing the total transmit power and maximizing the energy efficiency, which also includes the dissipation in the transceiver hardware.},

  abstract  = {Predicting the channel between a massive multiple input multiple output antenna and a car is a challenge, due to the short-term fading. It becomes essentially impossible by conventional extrapolation from past estimates if the car has moved by half a wavelength or more in space at the time when the channel estimate will be needed. This problem would prevent us from using the best fifth generation adaptive antenna downlink precoding schemes for very fast moving connected vehicles. A potential solution is to add another vehicle antenna, a "predictor antenna", which senses the channel in advance. In this paper, based on drive tests and channel measurements from a 64- element antenna to a car, we for the first time show that this concept works for massive MIMO downlinks. Thanks to the use of a predictor antenna, the complex OFDM downlink channels can be predicted with an accuracy that enables maximum ratio transmit beamforming with close to ideal beamforming gain for non-line-of-sight channels. Zero forcing transmission to two users results in a signal-to-interference ratio of 20 dB to 30 dB when predicting non-line-of-sight channels up to three wavelengths ahead in space. These first experiment shows that the predictor antenna concept is a potential solution to make fifth generation adaptive antennas work for very fast moving connected vehicles.},

  abstract = {Next-generation communication systems aim for providing pervasive services, including the high-mobility scenarios routinely encountered in mission-critical applications. Hence we harness the recently-developed reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) to assist the high-mobility cell-edge users. However, in the face of high Doppler frequencies, the existing RIS channel estimation techniques that assume block fading generally result in irreducible error floors. In order to mitigate this problem, we propose a new RIS channel estimation technique, which is the first one that performs minimum mean square error (MMSE) based interpolation for the sake of taking into account the time-varying nature of fading even within the coherence time. The RIS modelling invokes only passive elements without relying on RF chains, where both the direct link and RIS-reflected links as well as both the line-of-sight (LoS) and non-LoS (NLoS) paths are taken into account. As a result, the cascaded base station (BS)-RIS-user links involve the multiplicative concatenation of the channel coefficients in the LoS and NLoS paths across the two segments of the BS-RIS and RIS-user links. Against this background, we model the multiplicative RIS fading correlation functions for the first time in the literature, which facilitates MMSE interpolation for estimating the high-dimensional and high-Doppler RIS-reflected fading channels. Our simulation results demonstrate that for a vehicle travelling at a speed as high as 90 mph, employing a low-complexity RIS at the cell-edge using as few as 16 RIS elements is sufficient for achieving substantial power-effieincy gains, where the Doppler-induced error floor is mitigated by the proposed channel estimation technique.},

  abstract = {Wildfires are a significant natural hazard, resulting in financial losses, human deaths, and environmental damage. Due to the rising severity and frequency of wildfires, wildfire management and detection have recently received increased attention worldwide. Monitoring potential risk areas and early fire detection are critical factors for shortening the reaction time and reducing the potential damage. Conventional wildfire detection techniques like satellite imaging and remote camera-based sensing need more latency and low reliability. To tackle these limitations, this paper proposes a novel airborne UAV-based IoT (UIoT) system for wildfire sensing, detection, and extinguishing. It presents the design of low-cost and low-maintenance fire-detecting IoT nodes for large-scale deployment. It also proposes, investigates, and reports on several connectivity architectures using the LoRaWAN protocol for UIoT systems. We geolocate forest trees in a terrain-mapping exercise for precise fire localization. We then deploy an autonomous drone with a visual camera that utilizes our novel classification network to detect the presence of fire followed by fire detection and particle filter-based tracking to center fire at the center of the frame. We use a cloud back-end server for monitoring, analysis, and reporting. Our results show that our low-cost and long-range IoT nodes accurately detect fire within 1-5 min after fire ignition. Our fire classification network achieved an accuracy of 99.46% and a mean average precision of 99.64%. Numerical results suggest that the proposed UAV-IoT-based fire classification offers a fast and reliable wildfire recognition and extinguishing solution while minimizing power consumption and increasing the battery lifespan.}

Since the orders frequently change according to customer requirements, the synchronisation of purchase orders to support production to ensure on-time order fulfilment is of high importance. However, the inefficient and inaccurate order picking process has adverse effects on the order fulfilment. The objective of this paper is to propose an Internet of things (IoT)-based warehouse management system with an advanced data analytical approach using computational intelligence techniques to enable smart logistics for Industry 4.0.

  abstract = {The smart home is now an established area of interest and research that contributes to comfort in modern homes. With the Internet being an essential part of broad communication in modern life, IoT has allowed homes to go beyond building to interactive abodes. In many spheres of human life, the IoT has grown exponentially, including monitoring ecological factors, controlling the home and its appliances, and storing data generated by devices in the house in the cloud. Smart home includes multiple components, technologies, and devices that generate valuable data for predicting home and environment activities. This work presents the design and development of a ubiquitous, cloud-based intelligent home automation system. The system controls, monitors, and oversees the security of a home and its environment via an Android mobile application. One module controls and monitors electrical appliances and environmental factors, while another module oversees the home’s security by detecting motion and capturing images. Our work uses a camera to capture images of objects triggered by their motion being detected. To avoid false alarms, we used the concept of machine learning to differentiate between images of regular home occupants and those of an intruder. The support vector machine algorithm is proposed in this study to classify the features of the image captured and determine if it is that of a regular home occupant or an intruder before sending an alarm to the user. The design of the mobile application allows a graphical display of the activities in the house. Our work proves that machine learning algorithms can improve home automation system functionality and enhance home security. The work’s prototype was implemented using an ESP8266 board, an ESP32-CAM board, a 5 V four-channel relay module, and sensors.},
